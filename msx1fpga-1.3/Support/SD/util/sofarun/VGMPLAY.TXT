VGMPlay can play back music for quite a number of sound chips using various
common and less common sound expansions for MSX, such as the PSG, MoonSound and
Yamaha SFG. A detailed list can be found below.

Both the VGM and VGZ formats are supported. The compressed VGZ format takes
longer to load but also consumes less disk space. If so desired, VGZ files can
be manually decompressed to VGM with
[gunzip for MSX](https://bitbucket.org/grauw/gunzip) or PC.

The timing resolution is 50 or 60 Hz on MSX1 machines with a TMS9918 VDP, 300 Hz
on machines with a V9938 or V9958 VDP, and 4000 Hz on MSX turboR.

For more information on the VGM format see:

System Requirements
-------------------

  * MSX, MSX2, MSX2+ or MSX turboR
  * 128K main RAM
  * 16K video RAM
  * MSX-DOS 2


Supported sound chips
---------------------

The sound expansion required for playback is mentioned between parentheses.

  * AY-3-8910 PSG / YM2149 SSG x2 (built-in, MegaFlashROM SCC+)
  * YM2151 OPM (SFG-01/05)
  * YM2413 OPLL (MSX-MUSIC, FM-PAC)
  * YM3526 OPL (MSX-AUDIO, Music Module, MoonSound)
  * YM3812 OPL2 (MoonSound)
  * YMF262 OPL3 (MoonSound)
  * YMF278B OPL4 (MoonSound)
  * Y8950 MSX-AUDIO (Music Module, 256K sample RAM recommended)
  * K051649 Konami SCC
  * K052539 Konami SCC+
  * SN76489 DCSG x2 (Franky, Playsoniq, Musical Memory Mapper)


Usage instructions
------------------

Run VGMPlay from MSX-DOS 2, specifying the VGM file to play on the command line.

Usage:

    vgmplay [options] <file.vgm>

Note that the compressed VGZ format is not supported, rename the file to .vgm.gz
and extract it using gzip or your favourite decompression software to retrieve
the uncompressed VGM file.

Options:

  * `/l` Number of playback loops. Default: 2.
    
    Many VGM music loops once the end of the song is reached. With this setting
    you can specify how many times VGMPlay should play the repeating part before
    exiting. The amount is specified like `/L15`. Use `/L` or `/L0` to loop
    infinitely. This setting will have no effect for songs which donâ€™t loop.
    
  * `/b` Enter blackout mode during playback.
    
    This setting makes the screen go black during playback. For machines with a
    lot of VDP interference on the audio output, this may reduce the amount of
    interference.
    
  * `/o` Activate 1chipMSX timing workaround.
    
    Fue to a 1chipMSX bug, the timing is incorrect. If music plays too slowly,
    use this option to activate the workaround.

To configure Multi Mente to play VGM files, add the following lines to
MMRET.DAT:

    .VGM    VGMPLAY $T
    .VGZ    VGMPLAY $T


Development information
-----------------------

VGMPlay is free and open source software. If you want to contribute to the
project you are very welcome to. Please contact me at any one of the places
mentioned in the project information section.

You are also free to re-use code for your own projects, provided you abide by
the license terms.

Building the project with some of your own modifications is really easy on all
modern desktop platforms. On Mac OS X and Linux, simply invoke `make` to build
the binary and symbol files into the `bin` directory:

    make

Windows users can open the `Makefile` and build by pasting the line in the `all`
target into the Windows command prompt.

To launch the build in openMSX after building, put a copy of `MSXDOS2.SYS` and
`COMMAND2.COM` and some VGM files to test with in the `bin` directory, and then
invoke the `make run` command.

Note that the [glass](https://bitbucket.org/grauw/glass) assembler which is
embedded in the project requires [Java 7](http://java.com/getjava). To check
your Java version, invoke the `java -version` command.
