===================================================================
                           Introduction
===================================================================

SofaRun is an MSX-DOS 2 tool  that allows you  to run disk  (.DSK),
cassette (.CAS)  and cartridge  (.ROM)   images.  Various  settings
can  be set    and stored for  each game. It  can also  be  used to
launch normal MSX-DOS 2 and BASIC programs.

It features a joystick controlled file browser, ZIP files  support,
options  to  map  JoyMega buttons  to  keyboard  and "soft  reset",
allowing you to play lying on your sofa just like a lazy penguin!



===================================================================
                              License
===================================================================

You are allowed to freely  use and distribute SofaRun for  any non-
commercial usage.

This software is provided  'as-is', without any express  or implied
warranty.  In no  event will  the author  be held  liable for  any
damages arising from the use of this software.



===================================================================
                           Requirements
===================================================================

SofaRun works on  any MSX computer with MSX-DOS 2 and 32KB free
mapped memory.

MSX machines  with a  total of  128KB mapped  memory are supported,
assuming   that   you  use   COMMAND.COM   version   2.31  or lower
(versions   above  2.31    are allocating   an  extra   16KB memory
segment).

That beeing said, if you want to  launch a disk image  containing a
program using  mapped memory  (like Project  Melancholia or cracked
games from the 80's), you'll need more memory.

Also, launching  a  ROM  image may require more memory (when  using
the "Memory mapper" device)   or a  specific device.  Supported ROM
devices in SofaRun v4.0 are:

 * Memory mapper
 * turboR mapper
 * SD Snatcher
 * Snatcher
 * MegaRAM
 * ESE SCC
 * ESE RAM
 * MegaFlashROM SCC
 * GR8NET
 * MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD
 * Multi-MSXRAM
 * MegaFlashROM SCC+
 * Carnivore 2 - Flash
 * Carnivore 2 - RAM

The SRAM auto-save feature requires a Panasonic PAC or FM-PAC.


===================================================================
                             Features
===================================================================

 * ZIP files  support (see  the "ZIP  files support"  section   for
   details).

 * Disk   access when   running  ROMs.  You  can   save and   load,
   for example, your  King's  Valley stages  or  Game Masters  game
   states.
 
 * Option  to edit  text files  on any  MSX machine  (even MSX  1),
   using the great & free VEDIT.COM tool.
 
 * Basic  Copy,   Paste  and  Delete   operations  on  files    and
   directories.

 * SofaSet tool to control all MSX2 RCT settings.
   
 * Writing back tape images (.CAS) to real tape, thanks to  Martos'
   CAS2TAPE.COM tool.

 * SRAM auto-backup.

 * Game Master 1  and Game Master 2  support. Game Master 2  can be
   used only  with a  supported  flash  device, but  Game Master  1
   works without for small ROMs.

 * Soft reset: if you have selected JoyMega support, you can  reset
   the game by pressing the [A] and [Start] button simultaneously.

 * Editable   SR.INI file.   You  can  specify  your   "saves"  and
   "temporary" locations here,   define your  custom palettes,  and
   even your own file-type associations.

 * Save of all  settings for each game,  so that you don't  have to
   set them every time.

 * Support of external SCC  or SCC+ sound cartridge,if you  want to
   hear the "real thing".

 * PSC to SCC: you can redirect PSG sounds to an SCC cartridge, and
   define SCC waveform for each PSG channel.

 * Various settings, like other game loaders (video mode, language,
   CPU mode, MSX version).



===================================================================
                        Installing SofaRun
===================================================================

From your desktop computer, extract "sofarun.zip" somewhere to your
MSX-DOS2 mass storage device (SD card or hard drive).

Plug your mass storage device on you MSX, boot to MSX-DOS 2, go  to
the  directory where  you extracted  "sofarun.zip" using  the  "cd"
command, and  type "SR"  from  the  command line.  You should   see
the SofaRun  title  screen.   SofaRun   takes  no  file  arguments,
only these two options can be specified:

 /S: Skip the display of the title screen.

 /I: Ignore last  launched game,  and start  SofaRun from  current
     directory.



===================================================================
                       Supported file types
===================================================================

All file types associations here can be changed in the SR.INI  file
(see "The SR.INI file" section below).

 * .ROM
Cartridge images. Can be ROMs or MegaROMs.


 * .DSK
Disk image files, as used by MSX emulators. Several disk images can
be concatenated  into a  single .DSK  file. You'll  be able to swap
disks during game (see section "Swapping disks").


 * .CAS
Cassette images, as used by  MSX emulators. Those files are  loaded
using the "LOADCAS" tool from Martos.


 * .COM
MSX-DOS executables.


 * .BAT
MSX-DOS batch files.  Those files can  be launched but  also edited
(like described below for .INI and .TXT files).


 * .LDR
BASIC files.  ".BAS" files  are not  displayed to  distinguish them
from "loader" specific BASIC files.


 * .ZIP
PKZIP compressed files.  Contents of these  files can be  extracted
and played with a single click. See the "ZIP files support" section
for details.


 * .MIG
MSX compressed images. Those are displayed using MIGVIEW.COM.


 * .VGM
Video Game Music files. Those are played using Grauw's  VGMPLAY.COM
player.
 

 * .INI and .TXT
Those are considered as text files. SofaRun allows you to edit them
using  an  MSX  patched  version  of  the  excellent  VEDIT   tool.
Instructions for using VEDIT are displayed before launch.



===================================================================
                              Controls
===================================================================

Everything in SofaRun can be controlled with either the keyboard or
the joystick in port 1.

To  validate  something,   press   [Space]  key,  [Enter]   key  or
joystick [Button  A]. This  is referred  later in  this document as
[Validate].

To cancel  something,  press   [ESC] key  or  joystick  [Button B].
This is referred later in this document as [Cancel].



===================================================================
                          The game browser
===================================================================

This  is  what you  get  when you  launch  SofaRun: a  list  of all
supported files, and directories.

You can move in the entries  here using the keyboard arrows or  the
joystick.

To open the "Game" menu in order to launch you game, or change  to
another directory, just [Validate].

[Cancel] to enter the "Quit" menu.



===================================================================
                         The "Game" menu
===================================================================

This menu is  invoked by [Validating]  a game in  the game browser.
Following is a description of each menu entry.

                            ** Start **

Start the game!


                          ** Settings **

Edit settings for the game (see "Settings" menu below).


                         ** Erase SRAM **

Erases the  SRAM for  the current  game if  "PAC-SRAM auto-save" is
enabled in its settings.


                        ** Write to tape **

Write the current cassette image to tape (.CAS files only).


                        ** Write to disk **

Write the current  disk image to  floppy (.DSK files  only). Select
the target drive and [Validate] to start writing.


                            ** Back **

Go back to the game browser.



===================================================================
                        The "Settings" menu
===================================================================

This menu is invoked by selecting "Settings" in the "Game" menu. It
displays available settings for the game.

You can change a setting with the [Left] and [Right] cursor keys or
with the joystick in port 1.

At first, all settings are set to the default values. If you change
a setting, it will be  displayed with a star ("*").  This indicates
that this setting is  set and will be  used instead of the  default
value.

You   can  toggle   a  setting   between the   "set"  and "default"
states by [Validating].

Following is a description of each menu entry.


----------------------------- Actions -----------------------------

                           ** Apply **

Apply your settings choices and go back to the "Game" menu.


                           ** Cancel **

Cancel the changes made in the settings and return to the "Game" menu.


                      ** Reset to defaults **

Reset all settings to the default ones.



------------------------ Generic settings -------------------------

                         ** Video mode: **
                           (MSX 2 only)

Choose between 50Hz or 60Hz video modes here. Most of the games are
looking better in 60Hz mode.


                        ** Erase VRAM: **

Erase the VRAM first 16KBs to  0 before launching the game. Can  be
useful for flawed games that  expect the VRAM to be  completely set
to 0.


                          ** Palette: **
                           (MSX 2 only)

Choose between different color palettes for  the game. Palettes can
be defined in  the SOFARUN.INI file.  You can  for  example use the
MSX1 palette to have  the original look and  feel  of a game  on an
MSX2. The "CoolColors" palette by FRS also looks  very well on lots
of ROMs! See the "SOFARUN.INI" section below for  more details.


                     ** PAC-SRAM auto-save: **

If you have a PAC-SRAM  cartridge, its content will be  saved after
each game's run, and saved when you go back to SofaRun. This allows
to play  several games  using PAC  with no  danger of loosing saved
data. The generated SRAM backup file has the same base name as  the
game file, with extension replaced by ".USR".


                     ** Find Music-Module: **

Allow some games (mainly Compile  ones) to find and use  the Music-
Module sound cartridge.


-------------------------- Disk settings --------------------------

                         ** Start disk: **

SofaRun handles .DSK files  with concatenated disk images.  You can
select which disk image to boot to here.


                     ** Write enable disk: **

By default,  the .DSK  file you  have selected  is write-protected.
Enable this to allow writing. Note  that each time a .DSK image  is
launched, a "virtual" user disk  is added in last position.  It has
the same  base name  as the  .DSK file  with extension  replaced by
".USR". This virtual disk is only created if accessed.


                         ** Disk delay: **

Some games do not like the fact that disk accesses are quite faster
on an  SD card  or hard  disk compared  to original  floppies. This
leads to  graphical glitches  or even  crashes. Increase  the value
here until the problem is solved.


                  ** Simulate [CTRL] pressed: **

Free up some memory by allowing only one drive instead of two, just
like when you press the [CTRL] key at boot time.


                      ** No memory mapper **
                  
Simplifies memory handling by assuming  that the game is not  using
memory-mapped memory. Increases speed  but might cause crashes  for
games that do use the memory-mapped memory.



------------------------- turboR settings -------------------------

                          ** CPU mode: **

If you're the  happy owner of  a turboR, you  can define which  CPU
mode to use here.


                       ** Disable FM-PAC: **

Prevent  games from   using the  integrated  FM-PAC on  turboR,  so
you'll get standard PSG sounds. This allows to run  games in   R800
mode without FM-PAC sound glitches.


-------------------------- ROM settings ---------------------------

                        ** Pref. device **

Selects the prefered ROM device used to launch a .ROM file. If that
device does not exist or does not fit the requirements to launch  a
ROM, another device will be selected instead if possible.


                        ** Flash speed: **
       (MegaFlashROM SCC+ (SD) and Carnivore 2 devices only)

Sets flashing speed for the flash memory devices. Default speed for
MegaFlashROM SCC+ is 1x, default speed for MegaFlashROM SCC+ SD and
Carnivore 2 is 4x. MegaFlashROM SCC only supports 1x.


                          ** ROM type **

By default, SofaRun tries to guess  the type of the ROM  file  when
flashing it.   If this  does  not  work, you   can specify  a  type
here.


                        ** No subslots: **

Disables  subslots  for the ROM device when launching ROM.


                    ** Disable disk driver: **

Disable the  disk driver  when launching  ROM. Required  for Iligks
Episode IV.


                     ** Interruption mode: **

Change this to improve game speed or fix freezings and crashes.


                         ** A.I. level: **

Increase value to fix glitches or crashes.


                  ** Page switch optimization: **
                 ("Memory mapper" ROM device only)

Increase  value  to  reduce  disk  accesses.  Warning:  might cause
crashes if too high.


                        ** Game Master: **

You can select  to launch a  game with Konami's  Game Masters here.
"Memory mapper" ROM  device only supports  Game Master 1  for small
ROMs.


                        ** MSX version: **

You can lie about the version of your MSX here. This allows to play
Gradius 3 in MSX1 mode  for example. Well, there's little  interest
in that, but if you are playing  a game with the Game Master 2  and
want to use a custom palette, this might be useful: the Game Master
2 in MSX2 mode sets its own palette, and erases the custom  palette
before launching  the ROM.  This won't  happen if  you set  the MSX
version to MSX1!


                          ** Language: **

Set this to  "International" to play  the ROM in  English instead of
Japanese.


                          ** JoyMega: **

If  you have  a JoyMega  adapter and  a Megadrive  joypad, you  can
choose  between  different  configurations  here.  Some   "generic"
configurations are  provided in  the default  SOFARUN.INI file, but
you can add as  many configurations as you  want in this file.  See
the "SR.INI" section below for more details.

The 3 buttons configurations will be a bit faster compared to the 6
buttons one, but only [A] and [Start] buttons are available.


                      ** Disable keyboard: **

If you enable this, the keyboard will not be read and be  inactive.
As  reading the  JoyMega and  converting buttons  to keys  takes  a
while,  this  might  speeds  things  up  a  bit.  Use  this  if you
experience slowdowns when JoyMega is enabled.





----------------------- ROM sound settings ------------------------

                      ** Use external SCC: **

Flash devices usually emulate SCC  and SCC+ very well,  but  if you
are a "vintage fanatic", set this  to "Yes" to use  a real  SCC  or
SCC+  cartridge instead. You have to set which SCC slot to use with
the "SCC slot" setting below.


                          ** PSG port: **

You can redirect the default PSG port to another one here. Use "MFR
SCC+" to use  the MegaFlashROM SCC+  ports. Use "Disabled"  to mute
the PSG.


                       ** PSG channel #x: **

You can filter the 3 PSG  ports here. "Noise only" will only  allow
noise on the x channel. "Music only" will only allow music on the x
channel. "On" allows everything and "Off" disable everything.


                         ** PSG to SCC: **

Set this to "Yes" to also play PSG sounds on an SCC cartridge.  You
can select  which SCC  waveform is  associated to  each PSG channel
with the next settings. You have to set which SCC slot to use  with
the "SCC slot" setting below.


                       ** SCC Waveform x: **

Select which SCC   waveform is associated   to PSG  channel  x when
the  "PSG  to  SCC"  setting  is  enabled.  You  can  add and  edit
SCC waveforms in the SROM.INI file.


                          ** SCC slot: **

Select which SCC  slot to use  when "Use external  SCC" or "PSG  to
SCC"  settings  are  enabled  (there's  not  auto-detection  of SCC
cartridges yet in SofaRun).

Note that you might receive "SCC slot conflict" errors or  warnings
when launching ROM depending  of your slot layout.  Basically,  the
SCC slot specified here   can't be in the  same "main slot" as  the
RAM or flash device slot used for the game.



===================================================================
                        The "Write to tape" menu
===================================================================

This menu is invoked by  selecting [Write to tape] from  the "Game"
menu.


                     ** Write game to tape: **

Select  the  desired  baud  rate (1200,  1800,  2400  or  3600) and
[Validate] to start writing the game to tape.


                       ** Write silence: **

Select the silence duration  and validate to start  writing silence
to tape.


                            ** Back **

Go back to the "Game" menu.



===================================================================
                          The "Quit" menu
===================================================================

This menu is invoked by [Canceling] in the game browser.  Following
is a description of each menu entry.


                       ** Parent directory **

Change current directory to the parent one. If browsing a ZIP file,
exit to the containing directory.


                        ** Quick launch: **

Allows to quickly  launch any application  without browsing to  it.
These applications can be added in the SR.INI file (see "The SR.INI
file" section below).

Default Quick launch applications are:

 * SofaSet
Launches SOFASET.COM which  allows  you to  customize all  MSX2 RTC
chip settings.

 * JoyTest
Launches  FRS  JOYTEST.COM tool  to  test your  joystick,  joymega,
paddle, mouse or lightgun.

 * BLOAD"CAS:",r
Goes to BASIC then load and run a binary file from tape.

 * CLOAD
Goes to BASIC then load and run a BASIC file from tape.

 * RUN"CAS:"
Goes to BASIC then load and run ASCII BASIC file from tape.


                        ** Quit SofaRun **

Returns to MSX-DOS 2.


                         ** ZIP filter **
                         
You  can specifiy  here a  filter used  when displaying  ZIP  files
content. That can be specially useful if your ROMs are named  based
on  the TOSEC  naming convention. Keyboard input is allowed.

The filter  is using  a  classic wildcard system with "*" and "?":

  * "?" matches any single character.

  * "*" matches any sequence of characters.

Here are some examples:

 * "Z*" display all files starting with letter Z.

 * "*.ROM" display all ROM files.

 * "*(KONAMI)*" display all files released by Konami.

 * "*(199?)*" display all files released in the nineties.


                      ** SofaRun settings **

This will  invoke another  menu allowing  you to  edit the  default
settings inherited by all games. There are also some extra "UI
settings" in this menu (see section below).



                     ** Clean temporary files **

This  deletes all  temporary  files  generated by  SofaRun  from in
the "TMPPATH" directory, including *.UNZ directories.  Use this  if
you  run out  of disk  space or to solve corrupted files issues.

 * .UNZ files are individual files extracted from ZIP files.
 * .UNZ directories  are generated  when using  the [Extract  all]
   command on ZIP files.


                   ** Forget last flashed ROM **

Tells  SofaROM to  forget about  ROMs flashed  on non-volatile  ROM
devices. This forces a reflash on next game launch.


                  ** Copy <file_or_directory> **

Copy the current file or directory for later pasting.


                  ** Paste <file_or_directory> **

Paste the previously copied file or directory in current directory.
Directories are copied recursively.


                 ** Delete <file_or_directory> **

Delete the  current file  or directory.  Directories are completely
and recursively deleted.


                            ** Back **

Returns to the game or ZIP browser.



===================================================================
                             UI settings
===================================================================

Those  settings  are only  available  in the  "Quit"  menu "SofaRun
settings".

                       ** Show all files: **

Toggles display of  all files or  only supported ones.  You can use
this to check your hard disk  or SDCard for other files. Note  that
nothing happens  if you  select a  non-supported file  in the  game
browser.


                     ** Show command line: **
                     
Display the command line created when SofaRun launches an  external
application.


                        ** Quiet launch: **
                     
Do  not  display  any  text or  ask  for  launch  confirmation when
launching a .DSK or .ROM image.


                        ** UI video mode: **
                           (MSX 2 only)

Choose between 50Hz or 60Hz video modes for SofaRun's UI display.
                     

                        ** UI text color: **

Choose the text color SofaRun's UI display.


                        ** UI background color: **

Choose the background color SofaRun's UI display.


                        ** UI force 40 columns: **
                           (MSX 2 only)

Force  UI  display  in 40  columns  mode  instead of  80  on  MSX 2
machines.


===================================================================
                          The SR.INI file
===================================================================

You  can  setup different  things  in this  file.  Each section  is
documented, just have a look at the file. You can edit it  directly
from SofaRun.

Below is the default SR.INI file bundled with SofaRun:

===================================================================
                         ZIP files support
===================================================================

Selecting a ZIP file from the game browser displays its contents in
a way quite  similar to the  game browser. "Game"  and "Quit" menus
are available and work the same way.

When a game  file is selected,  it is extracted  to a "cache"  file
with  extenstion replaced  with ".UNZ".  Those .UNZ  files are  not
displayed by default  by  SofaRun.  You   can  delete  them   using
"Clean temporary files" from the "Quit" menu.

The [Extract all]  command allows to  extract the whole  content of
the  ZIP  file  (including sub-directories)  to  a  directory. This
directory is  made of  the ZIP  file base  name (file  name without
extension), and  placed in  the "TMPPATH"  (that you  can define in
SR.INI).



===================================================================
                             Error messages
===================================================================

* "Bad signature in <ZIPfile>"
<ZIPfile> seems corrupted. 

* "Unable to open <file>"
<file> does not exist or can't be opened for some reasons.

* "Unable to create <file_or_directory>"
<file_or_directory> can't be created for  some reasons.

* "Out of TPA memory"
The current directory  or ZIP file  is too big.  Try to split  your
games in several smaller directories or ZIP files.

* "Out of segments"
You  need more available segmented memory.  See the  "Requirements"
section for details.

* MSX-DOS 2 errors
When   an   MSX-DOS   2  error   happens   (disk   write  protected
for example), you'll   get  a  menu  in  which you    can choose to
Retry, Ignore or Abort the current operation.
